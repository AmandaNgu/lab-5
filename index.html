            <h3>Biography:</h3>

            <h4>Where Were You Born?</h4>
            <div class="first">
                <p> I was put on this <em> god forsaken earth</em> (Specifically, in Ajax) on October 16th, 2000. This
                    is where I started my long journey. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>What Schools Did You Attend?</h4>
            <div class="second">
                <p>I've attended a couple of schools in my life. I started my <em>rigorous</em> schooling at Altona
                    Forest Public school in Pickering.
                    I then, at the age of 5, moved to Barrie where I contiuned my education at Allendale Heights as well
                    as Hewitts Creek.
                    After graduating elementary I went to Innisdale Secondary School where I came more out of my shell
                    (because I had to)
                    I had joined many clubs and teams such as Rugby and Band.
                    After graduating Highschool I was <em>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*homeless✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</em> (got kicked out the
                    beginning of grade 12 lol) So I had to take time away from persuing my post secondary to work!
                    I worked for 2 years and then decieded to do Biotechnology at Canadore College! that is were I got
                    my first taste of programming. After first year I had come to the conclusion
                    that Biotech was fun, but not something I would want a career in. Although I did quite enjoy the
                    programming course I had using <em>PYTHON</em>.
                    <em>But thats when the PANDEMIC hit</em>
                    After seeing how courses were being taught for the pandemic, I decided that it was not the way I
                    would like to learn. So for 3 years I just <em> worked.</em>
                    I then saw that school were starting to have in person lessons so I decided it't time to start my
                    education back up.
                    So now I'm attending Georgian College for Computer Programming and Analysis!

            <h4>What Goals/Ambitions Do You Have?</h4>
            <div class="third">
                <p>My goal is to graduate this program with the best grades I can get and start up my programming
                    career! I also enjoy doing art so I would <em>ideally</em> like to try and intertwine my
                    digital art with my programming.
